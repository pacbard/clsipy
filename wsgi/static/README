Public, static content goes here.  Users can create rewrite rules to link to
content in the static dir.  For example, django commonly uses /media/
directories for static content.  For example in a .htaccess file in a
wsgi/.htaccess location, developers could put:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^application/media/(.+)$ /static/media/$1 [L]

Then copy the media/* content to yourapp/wsgi/static/media/ and it should
just work.

Note: The ^application/ part of the URI match is required. Some of the web links in the files in the folder 'static' might be changed to work on your own domain (e.g. example.html). Replace by hand with your domain name. The other files don't have to be changed to have the server working.
